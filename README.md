# PlayHouse

## Pre-amble

I apologise for any spelling or mistakes in this document, mostly written off my own thoughts so likely is pretty aweful.

## Concept/Goal

A basic mack of Minecraft mods to allow group play, investigation, creation and adventuring.

## Loader

Current: Forge

## Goals

The idea to allow multiple players to join the server and start playing.
The server should be fairly vanilla in the way mob characteristics and environments behalf.

The goal isn't to make the game hard to play but rather to allow creativity through building, redstone and inovation.

## Mods (Required or considered)

Things that the pack should include, but is also an option/suggestion list of modules that can be used to achieve this.

- Require only 1 player on the server to sleep in order to prevent unfair situations of players being swamped while another player may be AFK.
    - Single player sleep
- Chunk loading of some type to allow particular areas to always be active. Not as important when the server starts but as farms and processors begin to be built, keeping resources processing will become more important.
    - Historically, I used FTBTeams, and FTBChunks
        - These also allowed for team generation and /home commands.
    - OpenTeams is another alternative
- Voice chat across the server with channels
- Bedrolls to allow sleeping in the wild without resetting your spawn point.
- Graves
    - Allowing for the ability to contain inventory on death to prevent players loosing too much heart when they die.
    - This is apposed to KeepInventory which just encourages players to die without any price to be paid.
- Create
- Create Crafts & Additions
- Create Enchantment Industry
- Create Jetpack
- Create Ore Excavation
- Create Slice & Dice
- Create New Age
- Create Steam'n'Rails
    - These are a large criteria in Alexs' eyes
    - I've played with Create before, but not used it as a primary focus for the world before. Will be interesting.
- Multimine/Veinmine/Ultimine
    - Some way to vein mine in order to prevent players spending weeks digging holes.
- JEI/REI/??
    - Some form of item listing mod
- Map
    - Journeymap
    - 
- Backpacks
    - Sophisticated backpacks
        - Has some interesting plugins like;
            - Auto collect
            - Auto eat food
            - Auto stock player inventory from backpack
                - eg. Food, or Fireworks for example
            - Stack upgrades
            - XP storage
            - Auto repair equipment using stored XP
            - Fluid storage
            - Size increase
            - Auto dump to an inventory
    - Travellers packpacks
        - Has some interesting parts to it.
            - Contains a bedroll always which is nice.
                - This has a side effect of allowing it to be used to break bedrock in particular situations. (Unless patched)
            - Stores fluids
            - Stores tools as quick slots to keep them out of your inventory
            - There are more of course
            - Size increase
- Waystones or portals
    - Forge, I've used Waystones mod and it works quite well indeed.
        Contains waystones as well as teleporting pads that also work with items when they land on them.
- Some form of large storage solution.
    - I love Refined storage and AE2
        - Refined storage is easier to work with in my own opinion.
- Connectable storage of some type (beyond the large storage solution above)
    - This is for external storage to the above and/or single item storage
    - Most options here don't normally contain their own ability to interact with the storage as a player, only through piping and hoppers.
    - Options include;
        - Sophisticated storage
            - Contains Barrels and Chests
            - Controller to allow connecting many together for I/O
            - Size of containers can be increased and supports void options
        - Storage drawes
            - Contains Barrels and Chests
            - Controller to allow connecting many together for I/O
            - Size of containers can be increased and supports void options
        
- Logistics management (beyond the large storage solution above)
    - The ability to manage logistics, including power and fluids outside of the larger network
    - Options include (Again, Forge based)
        - Xnet
        - Integrated Dynamics
            - Like coding but with variables that you code
        - SFM (Super factory manager)
            - Is coding to manage input/output across large networks
            - Looks pretty interesting
        - Tims storage system
- Power
    - Create now has power but unsure how efficient it is
        - My normal goto for this is Powah with Flux Networks

### Cool mods to consider

- Easy villagers
    - I like this but on a multiplayer server I feel that this might be good to leave out as it somewhat cheeses the villagers
- Minecolonies
    - I love the idea of building a large scale village between many players with the goal of leaving them to live.
    - Lots of requirements to start with but continues to get bigger and bigger as time goes on.
    - It's a multiplayer joint project.
- Silent gear
    - Create cool tools with custom addons that allow for some interesting outcomes
- Apotheosis
    - Allows the collection and usage of spawners in your base which can have modifications such as
        - Be controlled with redstone
        - Remove requirements of the environment
        - Change spawners to use another mob using a mob egg.
        - Restrict range and light levels for spawners to control how they operate.
    - Good examples would be;
        - A wither skelly farm in your base or close.
        - Ender farm in your base. (Although teleporting might be complex).
